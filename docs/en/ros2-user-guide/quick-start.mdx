title: Quick Start
---

## Launch the Driver

```bash
# Source ROS2 environment, replace ${distro} with your ROS2 distribution
source /opt/ros/${distro}/setup.bash
# If built from source, overlay the workspace (Deb package users can skip)
# Replace ${WORKSPACE} with your workspace path, e.g., ~/wujihandros2
source ${WORKSPACE}/install/setup.bash

# Launch the driver
ros2 launch wujihand_bringup wujihand.launch.py
```

On successful launch, you will see the following output:

```text
[wujihand_driver]: Connected to WujiHand (right)
[wujihand_driver]: WujiHand driver started (state: 1000.0 Hz, diagnostics: 10.0 Hz)
```

## Verify Operation

Open a new terminal and check the joint states:

```bash
# Source ROS2 environment, replace ${distro} with your ROS2 distribution
source /opt/ros/${distro}/setup.bash
# If built from source, overlay the workspace (Deb package users can skip)
# Replace ${WORKSPACE} with your workspace path, e.g., ~/wujihandros2
source ${WORKSPACE}/install/setup.bash

ros2 topic echo /hand_0/joint_states --once
```

## Run Demo

```bash
# Wave demo: fingers curl and extend in sequence
ros2 run wujihand_bringup wave_demo.py
```

## Launch RViz Visualization

```bash
ros2 launch wujihand_bringup wujihand.launch.py rviz:=true
```
